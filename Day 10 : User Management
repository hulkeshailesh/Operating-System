2. If you are singed in as the "non-root" user who has been given sudo privilege, you can create or add a new use
with the following command:
sudo adduser <username>

devops@L014LPF2VD475:~$ adduser shubhali
adduser: Only root may add a user or group to the system.
devops@L014LPF2VD475:~$

devops@L014LPF2VD475:~$ sudo adduser shubhali
[sudo] password for devops:
Adding user `shubhali' ...
Adding new group `shubhali' (1004) ...
Adding new user `shubhali' (1004) with group `shubhali' ...
Creating home directory `/home/shubhali' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for shubhali
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
        Full Name []: Shubhali
        Room Number []: 102
        Work Phone []: 0
        Home Phone []: 0
        Other []: Kid
Is the information correct? [Y/n] Y
devops@L014LPF2VD475:~$ id shubhali
uid=1004(shubhali) gid=1004(shubhali) groups=1004(shubhali)
devops@L014LPF2VD475:~$ cat /etc/passwd|grep shubhali
shubhali:x:1004:1004:Shubhali,102,0,0,Kid:/home/shubhali:/bin/bash

As devops user has no rights to access the shubhali home directory, hence its permission denied.
Here, shubhali home directory can access by user shubhali or root as super user only.
devops@L014LPF2VD475:~$ cd /home/shubhali/
-bash: cd: /home/shubhali/: Permission denied

Significance of /etc/skel:
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...

Whenever new user has been created on the operating system, default and require files like .profile,.bashrc,.bash_logout copied from 
/etc/skel, to the home directory of the new user.
/etc/skel is a skeleton directory for the newly created user.


User Modification:

User can be modified using usermod command

Here, /etc/sudoers file has ownership of root and we try to access this file but getting below error,

shubhali@L014LPF2VD475:/root$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers
[sudo] password for shubhali:
shubhali is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
shubhali@L014LPF2VD475:/root$

After the user modification where we have provided the sudo access to user i.e. vaishali
root@L014LPF2VD475:~# usermod -aG sudo vaishali

Now, try to access the /etc/sudoers file from vaishali home directory, its accessible,

root@L014LPF2VD475:~# su vaishali
To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
See "man sudo_root" for details.

vaishali@L014LPF2VD475:/root$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers
[sudo] password for vaishali:

Specifying explicit User privileges in /etc/sudoers:

# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

for normal user to have sudo access, (same like root access but his/her own root privileges)
vaishali ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
