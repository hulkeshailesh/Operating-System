Softline or Symbolic Link:

- Commonly referred to as symbolic links
- Soft links link together non-regular and regular files. 
- They can also span multiple filesystems. 
- By definition, a soft link is not a standard file, 
but a special file that points to an existing file.

---

Hard Link:
File created (Original File) - hard linked created (hardlinked file) 
If Original file deleted, still we can access the content of file 
from hardlinked created file

Why ?
because, in hard link, file shares the same inode (address).

Soft Link:
File created (Original File) - Soft linked created (hardlinked file) 
If Original file deleted, you can't access the content of original file
from softlinked file.

SoftLink:
If Original file renamed, then

The content of the file could not be found because the soft link points to the name,
that was changed and not to the content.

Create two empty files and add content to it.
# touch cat.txt
# touch dog.txt

Created hardlink for cat.txt and softlink for dog.txt
# ln cat.txt cat_harlink.txt
# ln -s dog.txt dog_softlink.txt

root@L014LPF2VD475:/home/devops/harshada# ls -ltr

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  7 May 22 20:25 dog_softlink.txt -> dog.txt

>> Here, We have renamed the cat.txt (HARD LINK)
root@L014LPF2VD475:/home/devops/harshada# mv cat.txt catt.txt
root@L014LPF2VD475:/home/devops/harshada# ls -ltr
total 12
-rw-r--r-- 2 root root 13 May 22 20:24 catt.txt
-rw-r--r-- 2 root root 13 May 22 20:24 cat_harlink.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 13 May 22 20:24 dog.txt
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  7 May 22 20:25 dog_softlink.txt -> dog.txt

Now, check the content of both files, catt.txt, cat_harlink.txt
root@L014LPF2VD475:/home/devops/harshada# cat catt.txt
This is cat.
root@L014LPF2VD475:/home/devops/harshada# cat cat_harlink.txt
This is cat.

>> Here, We have renamed the dog.txt (SOFTLINK)
root@L014LPF2VD475:/home/devops/harshada# mv dog.txt dogg.txt
root@L014LPF2VD475:/home/devops/harshada# ls -ltr
total 12
-rw-r--r-- 2 root root 13 May 22 20:24 catt.txt
-rw-r--r-- 2 root root 13 May 22 20:24 cat_harlink.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 13 May 22 20:24 dogg.txt
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  7 May 22 20:25 dog_softlink.txt -> dog.txt

Now, check the content of both files, Original renamed, hence link file is not worked
root@L014LPF2VD475:/home/devops/harshada# cat dogg.txt
This is dog.
root@L014LPF2VD475:/home/devops/harshada# cat dog_softlink.txt
cat: dog_softlink.txt: No such file or directory
root@L014LPF2VD475:/home/devops/harshada#
