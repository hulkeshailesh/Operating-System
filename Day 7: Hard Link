Link:
- Link is a pointer to a file or directory.

Hard link
Soft link (symboic link)

Hard Link:
Every file on the linux filesystem starts with a single hard link.
The link is between the filename and the actual data stored on the filesystem.

By default, when we create a file on filesystem, it will create a single hardlink.

Hard link created: 
Syntax: ln original_filename link_filename

root@L014LPF2VD475:/home/devops/harshada# ln harsh_profile.txt /tmp/harsh_hardlink.txt

Link count increase by 1 : i.e. now link count is 2.
root@L014LPF2VD475:/home/devops/harshada# ls -ld /tmp/harsh_hardlink.txt
-rw-r--r-- 2 root root 66 May 20 11:43 /tmp/harsh_hardlink.txt
root@L014LPF2VD475:/home/devops/harshada#
root@L014LPF2VD475:/home/devops/harshada# ls -lt
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 2 root root 66 May 20 11:43 harsh_profile.txt

- When changes are made to one filename, the other reflects those changes.
- The permission, link count, ownwership, timestamp and the file content are 
the exact same.
- If the original file is deleted, the data still exists under the secondary hardlink.
- The data is only removed from your drive when all the links to the data have been
removed.

Inode : Address of file located on storage media.
root@L014LPF2VD475:/home/devops/harshada# ls -li harsh_profile.txt /tmp/harsh_hardlink.txt
29391 -rw-r--r-- 2 root root 133 May 20 12:02 /tmp/harsh_hardlink.txt
29391 -rw-r--r-- 2 root root 133 May 20 12:02 harsh_profile.txt
root@L014LPF2VD475:/home/devops/harshada#

In Hardlink, files shared same inode values, hence these files are identical data.

Hard Link Limitation:
It can only be created for regular files (not directories or special files).
Also, Hard Link cannot span multiple filesystem.
